Typescript / React web app for Nostr NIP-28 Badge Management. 
- browse badges by relay
- create / edit / delete / award a badge
- link to badge issuer's nostr.directory and badges.page profile pages

This code is experimental, and written as a learning exercise. 
For better code see [badges.page](https://github.com/verbiricha/badges).

This code demonstrates:
- Using [nostr-tools](https://github.com/nbd-wtf/nostr-tools) to implement [NIP-28](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/58.md) within a client
- using [NIP-07](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/07.md) to get public / private keys from Nostr Extension (nos2x, getalby)
